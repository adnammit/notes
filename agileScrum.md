# Agile

## What is Agile?
* **Agile software development** is a set of methodologies characterized by:
	- iterative development
	- evolving requirements/solutions
	- frequent inspection and adaptation
* this enables development teams to adjust smoothly to changing requirements
	- "Cope better with change"
	- be more in control of the state of development/schedule
	- increased quality of deliverables
* there are different implementations of Agile (like Scrum and kanban) that may be chosen depending on the needs of a project or team

## Scrum
* well-suited for complex, iterative work like a new product or feature development
* Scrum is lighter weight, widely used "process framework"
	- low overhead: spend less time managing, more time doing
* Scrum is characterized by:
	- Roles
	- Artifacts
	- Time Boxes
* Scrum teams commit to completing an increment of work over the course of a **sprint**
* **scrum ceremonies** allow the team to reflect on and improve the process
	- **sprint planning**
	- **stand up/daily scrum**
	- **sprint review**
	- **sprint retro**

## Kanban
* well-suited for support and services
* Limit work in progress, maximize efficiency and flow
* Focus on reducing the time a project or user story takes
* use of a visual kanban board helps monitor and improve the flow
