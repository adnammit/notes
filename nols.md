## Patient Assessment System PAS
### Size-up the scene
* Don't create more patients. Priorities are:
	1. yourself
	2. bystanders and rescuers
	3. the patient
* situational triage:
	1. Survey the scene for hazards: "My safety is number one"
		- Immediate danger to rescuers
		- Immediate danger to bystanders
		- Immediate danger to patients
	2. Determine what might have caused the accident or injury "What happened to you?"
		- Mechanism of Injury (MOI)
	3. Protect yourself from bodily substances (Body Substance Isolation or BSI) "Don't get that on me"
	4. Determine the number of patients "How Many more?"
	5. Form a general impression of the patient. Hurt or not hurt? Sick or not sick? "How alive?"


### Initial Assessment: Survey the patient for immediate threats to life
* Identify yourself and your level of training.
* Obtain consent to treat (unless unconscious or a minor w/out a parent)
* Ask patient's name and what happened. If the pt is unconscious, cannot remember or if they fell, immediately stabilize the head.
* Establish responsiveness. Attempt to wake the patient. If there is an obvious mechanism for spine injury, protect the spine.
* ABCDE:
	- Airway management: Look in the patient's mouth. Clear any obstructions
	- Breathing adequacy: Look, listen, and feel. Expose and look for chest injuries.
	- Circulation: Assess for presence of pulse and signs of circulation. Control life-threatening bleeding.
	- Decision on Disability: If there is any chance that the patient has a spine injury, maintain protection of the spine.
	- Expose any serious injuries. Examine the injured site, their "Chief Complaint"


### Complete physical exam, vital signs and history
#### Head to Toe (Physical Exam)
* Complete a head to toe assessment:
	- "LAF" at your patient: Look, ask, feel, and listen
	- tell them what you're doing as you're doing it, **even if they're unconscious** (they may be able to hear you but can't respond)
	- Check circulation, sensation and motion (CSM) in all four extremities
	- Head to Toe, Step by Step:
		* Head:
			- with fingertips, examine all the way around the cranium
			- palpate optical orbit, cheekbones and jaw
			- check inside ears for anything that is not earwax (blood, brain fluid)
			- have pt clench jaw, move side to side -- "does it hurt?"
		* Neck
			- expose the neck - any protrusions?
			- ask if they wear medical tags (or have any on their phone)
			- walk fingers along the clavicals to expose injury
		* Shoulders
			- hands on either side of the shoulder joint, one anterior (front), one posterior (back), compress
		* Rib Cage
			- hand on the upper part of the rib cage, towards pt's back. "take a big breath, any pain?"
			- repeat with hands on the bottom of the rib cage
		* Stomach
			- have pt locate their belly button. centering your hand over it, roll your hand across the belly
		* Pelvis
			- place hands on outside of pelvis at the tops of the hip bones and compress
		* Arms and Legs
			- use both hands to compress with opposing force the upper and lower arm/leg
			- ask pt to bend arm/leg
			- Feet:
				* "Step on the gas"
				* "Pull your toes towards your nose"
				* take note of the pt's temperature inside their shoes
			- Hands:
				* "Squeeze my fingers"
				* "Roll your wrists around"
				* take note of the skin - is it dry? hot? cold? clammy?
			- direct the pt's gaze away. ask which finger/side of foot you're touching
			- "any tingling, numb sensation?"
		* Back
			- if the pt is inert, roll them onto their back
			- starting at the place where the skull meets the vertebrae, walk fingers down the spine to the tailbone
			- using a broad hand, press kidneys

#### Vital Signs & History
* Note time taken: take them every 15' and then less often if the patient is stable
	- Level of Responsiveness (LOR): tap them on the elbow to wake them up if they're sleeping
		* awake and oriented
		* awake and disoriented
		* unconscious
	- Heart Rate (HR):
		* Beats per minute (average is 60-100)
		* strong or weak
		* pulse can be taken:
			- radial: wrist, taken here if the patient is awake and consenting
			- corotid: neck, taken here if the patient is unconscious
	- Respiratory Rate (RR):
		* breaths per minute (average is 12-20)
		* easy or labored
		* putting a hand on their shoulder can help monitor their breathing rate
		* people will breathe differently if they know they are being monitored - for an accurate reading take it directly after taking HR while still holding their wrist
	- Skin Color, Temperature and Moisture (SCTM)
		* color: check inside of their lower lip -- pink to pale
		* temp: put your hand inside their shirt collar, high on their chest
		* moisture: sweaty, clammy or dry
* Patient History
	- Name
	- Age
	- Chief Complaint
	- SAMPLE:
		* Symptoms: In addition to the chief complaint
		* Allergies: "Are you allergic to anything?"
		* Medications: "Do you take any medications? Do you have it with you? Did you take it today?"
			- includes recreational drugs
		* Pertinent medical history: "Do you see a doctor for any medical condition?"
		* Last fluid/food intake, last urine/bowel output: "When did you last eat and drink? How much?"
		* Events: "What have you been doing today?" "Did anything cause this event?"

### Next steps:
- Complete patient care
- Make evacuation decision
- Monitor your patient (check CSMs, take vitals)

#### Notes about Assessment
* Signs vs Symptoms:
	- signs are seen, measured
	- symptoms are felt
* for everything you are noticing, ask: "is this normal for you? Is that your usual breakfast? Does your left foot usually angle out to the side more than the right?"

Emergency and Evacuation Plans
rgency response and evacuation plans are an essential part of wilderness medicine. A little bit of planning can go a
long way in supporting
requi
an efficient emergency response. You may be able to evacuate the patient yourself or you may
re assistance. Listed below are a few relevant factors that should be considered in an emergency response plan
Pre-Plan
.Rese
arch local search and rescue, sheriff's office or emergency services. How do you contact them? What can they
do?
Tell someone where you plan to go and when you plan to return.
Pack a communication device (cell or satellite phone, radio, Personal Locator Beacon) and a signaling device (tire
starter, mirror, bright tape/fabric). Know how to use it. Make sure it works in your planned travel area
Pack navigation tools (map, compass, GPS). Know how to use them.
Pack a first aid kit and survival gear
Emergency Response and Evacuation Plan
Use your WFA Field Guide to guide your treatment and evacuation decisions.
o Most evacuations are not urgent, there is no life or limb threat.
o If life or limb is in jeopardy a rapid evacuation, by a prompt and safe method, is warranted.
Ask for help or do it yourself? Consider
o Distance to road
o Difficulty of terrain
o Weather
o Available shelter, food, water
o Group strength and stamina
o Ability to communicate with rescue services
If you call for help with cell/radio/satellite phone:
o Prepare your call. Use the radio report template.
o Be able to describe your location. Use coordinates if possible.
o Make a clear statement of your needs and/or plan
If you send for help
o Send a team: Ideally three or four people with camping equipment
o Send a written plan of your situation and intentions
Send, in writing, an exact location. Use coordinates if possible.

Head Injury
The brain can be injured by bruising, bleeding or swelling. The earliest reflection of this is often a change in the patient s
level of responsiveness (LOR)
Signs and Symptoms of Mild Head Injury
Brief change in LOR
Nausea and/or isolated vomiting
. Headache, dizziness and/or lethargy
Amnesia
Temporarily blurred vision or "seeing stars"
Treatment Principles for Mild Head Injury
2. If evacuation is prolonged or delayed let the patient rest, but wake him or her every couple of hours to assess LOR. EiC
3. Monitor the patient for developing signs of serious head injury. mrING
Signs and Symptoms of Serious Head Injury
LOR: Not awake and oriented. Disoriented, irritable, combative
The patient may also experience a worsening headache, vision disturbances, repeated vomiting, lethargy,
sleepiness, poor balance or seizures.
Skull fracture: blood from ears or nose, obvious injury
Treatment Principles for Serious Head Injury
1. Consider positioning the patient on his or her side.
2. Do not apply direct pressure to control bleeding: use diffuse pressure with a bulky dressing
3. Protect the spine.
4. Evacuate immediately.
Evacuation Guideline: Head Injury
Evacuate if there was any loss of consciousness or signs and symptoms of mild head injury.
. Rapidly evacuate if there are distinct changes in the patient's mental status (disoriented, irritable, combative) or there
are any signs and symptoms of a serious head injury
