### NEW STUFF:
testwc: display everything i did for test
diws: diff ignoring whitespace, newlines and comments
linkorg [org]: alias for copy_org, links org's data to alr repo site
find_pf_clients: list all process flow clients
sync_pf_clients: copy the data for all pf clients
sync_client_data: copy data for multiple clients
roll_changed: roll what's changed between master and master's parent
`git lg4` is the nicest i think

### BASH STUFF
* add a script to backup changes to ~/backup or dev-lnx (like denny's good_morning)
* get git completion to work
* make the git equivalent of `sall` (grep for multiple expressions)
* do automated update/rebase/roll_out more better -- adapt alex's update script to include master?
    - actually i think you'll always want to use alias roll_changed b/c that will roll stuff you didn't change -- stuff you're deving you should be manually rolling

### ATOM
* make find-replace better
* get git-blame to work


### GIT
* what is all this `revs` shit?
* what is up with all this git diff shit -- are there helpful aliases?
* what is up with all this git log shit -- are there helpful aliases?


### RELEASE 1/11

* common
* process_flow
* web/: lib, maint, web, app
